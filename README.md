The above files include a fraction of my work at the University of Cincinnati during my Master's degree in Business Analytics. 

**Appendix**

**Statistical Modeling - Linear Regression Modeling** - Includes data exploration, cleaning, identifying response variables, regression using single factors, checking collinearity, modeling count data, and automated algorithms.

**Simulation Modeling and Methods** - The simulation final document is a Winters forecasting final project I have created in Excel. The Excel Solver tool was used to find optimal smoothing parameters. 

**Pizza_Data_Project.rmd above.** - Data Wrangling - (R Final Project) data is a project of data cleaning, preparation, visualizaton, and then summary of pizza reviews and ratings across the country. I have published the data into an HTML file:

**Capstone Report**  - My capstone report is a continuation of the Pizza data project. Both linear and nonlinear models were examined to select the best model in my dataset. Training and testing subsets were created and model comparison was examined with mathematical values of MSE, R-Squared, Adjusted R-Squared, AIC, and BIC. I used the LASSO method, Random Forest, and Boosting for Regression Trees.  

**Combined Code_probability** - The R file is the code for a probability modeling class project while the word doc includes the output and explanation. 

**Final.docx** - Statistical Computing Final project done in R and SAS
